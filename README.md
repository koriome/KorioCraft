# KorioCraft
### a shallowly named minecraft modpack that focuses on adventure

imagine a world where your modpack doesn't overwhelm you with everything all at once...

 

you imagining? cool.

 

well, there's no longer a need to imagine cause koriocraft is here to save the day!

 

this modpack mainly adds more structures to the map that you can find, a helluva lot of quality-of-life improvements, some weird black magic here and there, and a cool ass piece of broccoli on the main menu. (there's more but i wouldn't care to explain)

 

i kinda just wanted a modpack that catered to my playstyle while still having that feeling of vanilla mc. you can and should play this on a server with your friends

 

this is also only for 1.18.1 fabric rn, i do not like forge whatsoever LMAOOOOO
